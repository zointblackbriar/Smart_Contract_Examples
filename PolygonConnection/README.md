# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

### TEST CALL

You can use the following test curl calling for the testing purpose 

```bash
curl https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/{id} \
-X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}'
```

### ETHERSCAN VERIFICATION

Use the following commands: 

```bash
npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan
npx hardhat verify --network matic 0x4b75233D4FacbAa94264930aC26f9983e50C11AF
